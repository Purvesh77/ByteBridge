# ByteBridge: Enhancing Programmer Skills

## Introduction

ByteBridge is a social media platform tailored for programmers to elevate their CP/DSA (Competitive Programming/Data Structures and Algorithms) skills. Whether you're a novice seeking improvement or an expert in search of new challenges, ByteBridge offers a diverse range of features to cater to your needs.

## Challenges Faced

Programmers often encounter the following hurdles:

- Time-consuming search: Scouring multiple platforms like GFG, Codeforces, and Leetcode for suitable practice questions can be tedious.
- Difficulty selection: Finding questions of appropriate difficulty level can be challenging, leading to frustration.
- Lack of motivation: Without a structured approach to practice, maintaining motivation becomes difficult.

## Our Solution

- **Centralized practice questions**: Access practice questions from various sources, including Codeforces and Leetcode, all in one platform.
- **Skill-level recommendations**: Utilizing machine learning scripts and Python libraries, ByteBridge recommends practice questions tailored to your current skill level.
