### Social Media Community for Programmers

This platform is designed to help programmers level up their CP/DSA (Competitive Programming/Data Structures and Algorithms) skills by providing a comprehensive set of features. Whether you're a beginner looking to improve your problem-solving abilities or an experienced programmer seeking new challenges, our platform has something for everyone.

### Problem Faced

As a programmer, you may have encountered the following challenges:

* Time-consuming search: It can be frustrating and time-consuming to visit multiple platforms, such as GFG, Codeforces, and Leetcode, to find suitable practice questions that match your skill level.
* Difficulty selection: Finding questions that are appropriately challenging can be a struggle. It's common to end up with questions that are either too easy or too difficult, hindering your progress.
* Lack of motivation: Without a structured approach to practice and improvement, it's easy to lose motivation and struggle to make consistent progress.

### Our Solution

Our platform aims to address these challenges and provide an efficient solution for programmers looking to enhance their skills. Here's how our platform helps you:

* Centralized practice questions: Instead of visiting multiple platforms, you can access practice questions from various sources, including Codeforces, Leetcode, and more, all in one place. Say goodbye to switching between websites and wasting time.
* Skill-level recommendations: Our platform incorporates machine learning scripts and Python libraries to recommend practice questions based on your current skill level. By considering factors such as ratings, tags, and more, we ensure that the questions provided are suitable for your growth as a programmer.
* Interactive features: In addition to practice questions, our platform offers a range of interactive features, including discussion forums, chat rooms (limited to friends), and user profiles. These features enable you to connect with fellow programmers, engage in meaningful discussions, and build a strong coding community.
